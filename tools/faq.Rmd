<summary>Why does rig create a user package library?</summary>
>
>Installing non-base packages into a user package library has several
> benefits:
>
> - The system library is not writeable for regular users on some systems
>   (Windows and Linux, typically), so we might as well create a
>   properly versioned user library at the default place.
> - Some tools need a clean R environment, with base packages only, and do
>   not work well if user packages are installed into the system library.
>   E.g. `R CMD check` is such a tool, and https://github.com/r-lib/revdepcheck
>   is another.
> - You can delete an R installation (e.g. with `rig rm`) and then
>   install it again, without losing your R packages.

<summary>Why does rig install pak?</summary>
>
> To be able to install R packages efficiently, from CRAN, Bioconductor or
> GitHub, right from the start. pak also supports installing system libraries
> automatically on some Linux systems.
>
> If you don't want `rig add` to install pak, use the `--without-pak` option.

<details>
<summary>Why does rig change the permissions of the system library
(on macOS)?</summary>
>
> To make sure that you don't install packages accidentally into the system
> library. See "Why does rig create a user package library?" above.

<summary>Why does rig set the default CRAN mirror?</summary>
>
> To avoid the extra work the users need to spend on this.
>
> The https://cloud.r-project.org mirror is usually better than the
> other, in that it is a CDN that is close to most users, and that it is
> updated more often.
>
> If you want to use a different mirror, you can set the `repos` option
> in your `.Rprofile`, so the rig repo settings will be ignored.
>
> You can also use the `--without-cran-mirror` option of `rig add`.

<summary>Why does rig set up P3M?</summary>
>
> P3M ([Posit Public Package Manager](https://packagemanager.posit.co/client/#/))
> is generally superior to a regular CRAN mirror on Windows and many Linux
> systems.
>
> On Linux it includes binary packages for many popular distributions.
>
> On Windows, it includes up to date binary packages for older R versions as
> well.
>
> To avoid P3M use the `--without-p3m` option (or the legacy `--without-rspm`)
> option of `rig add`.

<summary>How is rig different from RSwitch?</summary>
>
> While there is a small overlap in functionality, rig and
> [RSwitch](https://rud.is/rswitch/) are very different.
> I suggest you look over the features of both to decide which one suits
> your needs better.
>
> If you like rig and also like the extra features of RSwitch, then you can
> use them together just fine: changing the default R version in RSwitch also
> changes it in rig and vice versa. You can use the rig cli and the RSwitch
> app together, or you can also use both menu bar apps at the same time.

<summary>Which domains does rig download files from?</summary>
>
> Here is the list of domains that you need to enable in your proxy.
> Note that some of these, in particular the GitHub ones,  might 
> trigger redirects.
>
> - https://api.r-hub.io/rversions for resolving R versions, i.e. this is
>   needed for `rig install`, `rig available`, etc.
> - `rig install` downloads pak from https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak
>   unless requested otherwise.
> - `rig install` sets https://cloud.r-project.org as the default CRAN 
>   mirror, unless requested otherwise.
> - `rig install` sets https://packagemanager.posit.co as the Posit
>   Package Manager CRAN mirror on supported Linux systems, unless
>   requested otherwise.
> - `rig install` downloads the EPEL package from 
>   https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel on RHEL systems.
> - `rig system rtools` downloads Rtools from the following URLs on 
>   Windows: 
>   * https://github.com/r-hub/rtools44/releases,
>   * https://github.com/r-hub/rtools43/releases,
>   * https://github.com/r-hub/rtools42/releases,
>   * https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools
> - https://github.com/R-macos/gcc-darwin-arm64/releases, 
>   https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases and whatever
>   domains Homebrew is using, to download system packages for 
>   `rig sysreqs` on macOS.
